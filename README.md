# Data used for the Msc Thesis "Automated Analysis of Cyber Attack Reports"

The csv files 'rcatt training data original' and 'training dataset full' were used in the 'data merging' code which can be found in the 2aCTI repository. 

The first csv was cloned from Legoy et al.'s Github repository (https://github.com/vlegoy/rcATT) while the second csv was assembled for the purpose of this thesis.
